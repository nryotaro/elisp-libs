;;; Commentary:

;; anejil automatically activates a Python venv with pyvenv package.
;; When you open a file in python-mode,
;; it searches for the venv directory near the file, and activates it.
;; When you open a Python file,
;; anejil searches for a venv directory with a name in `anejil-venv-dirnames`.
;; The search behavior is similar to that of `locate-dominating-file`.
;; The directory name with a smaller index has higher priority
;; than that with a greater index.
